## Setup (very quick)

After Installation, Click "Need an API key," which will take you to Google Gemini's website. Here, click "Get API Key" and "Create API Key."

Select "Gemini API" as your "project." Then copy and paste it into the extention and click "Save Key". 

That's all! You are done. Your key will be stored locally.

## Usage

### Screen Shot

Select "Create from Screenshot" on the extension while being on the tab with your message(s). 

In the screenshot, include all texts containing details of the event. External information that may be caught should not affect the process, but it is best to avoid them. 

The screenshot might take a few seconds to load. If no confirmation page pops up after over 10 seconds, please doublecheck you API key, or remake your key.

Click ESCAPE to exit screenshot mode. 
After the screenshot, you will be taken to the confirmation page.

### Quick Add

Instead of screenshotting the message, paste it here, and you will be taken to the confirmation page.

### Confirmation Page

Here, you can edit your event(s). Adjust timings, date, ect. Fill in any empty Date/Time fields. (Smart filling coming soon).

(You may also invite others and it will show up in the calendar for confirmation too!)
